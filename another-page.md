<p>Abstract: What is the effect of Twitter on political participation? I address this question by studying how the spread of this social network affected voting behavior and donations to politicians during the last three US presidential elections. First, I develop a novel measure of Twitter penetration by using location data collected from users. To address endogeneity in the diffusion of Twitter across regions, I exploit variation in the popularity of sport teams that signed new players with Twitter accounts, making therefore the social network more interesting for their fans. Instrumental variables estimates do not show significant effects of Twitter on average participation, intended both as turnout and donations to politicians. On the other hand I find a differential effect across parties, with the Democratic Party being penalized in terms of votes and the Republican Party receiving more donations. I provide two pieces of evidence on mechanisms. First, I show that Twitter reduces voters' information about politics and increases political polarization. Second, by downloading and categorizing tweets written by users I show that the majority of users write about sport or entertainment and ignore politics for most part of the year. Peaks in interest happen only during presidential debates, when both the quantity of partisan tweets and the average sentiment favor the Republican Party.</p>
