### [Reconciliation Narratives: The Birth of a Nation after the US Civil War](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3816811) 
*(with Elena Esposito, Alessandro Saia and Mathias Thoenig)*

<summary>Abstract: </summary>
<p>We study how the spread of the Lost Cause narrative -a revisionist and racist retelling of the US Civil War- shifted both opinions and behaviors toward reunifying the country and racially alienating African Americans. Drawing on a large set of archival data from between 1910 and 1920, we reconstitute a monthly record of the staggered screenings across US counties of The Birth of a Nation, a blockbuster movie that popularized the Lost Cause narrative across large segments of the population. Our empirical analysis shows that the movie induced (i) a semantic shift in the public discourse toward more patriotic and less divisive language on post-Civil War nation building; (ii) a surge in patriotism with an increased enlistment rate in the US military; and (iii) a cultural convergence between former Confederate and Unionist states with a rise in the adoption of first names traditionally associated with the former enemy's regional identity. We go on to document how the racist content of the narrative helped foster reconciliation through a common enemy rhetorical argument. While we find that the movie strengthened discrimination against African Americans in public discourse and the labor market, our quantitative estimates suggest that 55% of the total effect of the movie on reconciliation was indirectly mediated precisely through this rise in discrimination. All of our findings are detected within both former Confederate and Unionist states.</p>

### The power of app–based experiments
*(with Paolo Pin)*
<details>
<summary>Draft available upon request</summary>
<p>
We test the same pool of subjects on a series of standard tasks in behavioral economics, assigning randomly half of the pool to a classical laboratory and letting the other half perform the experiment on their smartphones, outside the lab, with an app that we have developed.
We measure the difference in behavior between the two treatments.
Behavior is similar across samples: participants respond essentially in the same way with respect to standard behavioral measures, effort, focus, cognitive tasks, strategical reasoning and beliefs about the actions of other players.
We find anyway some differences: subjects on the app (i.e., outside the lab) are more prone to errors on boring tasks, prefer to provide a wrong answer rather than letting time expire, and tend to be slightly more generous and trustful with respect to the other subjects in the same session.

### [The Impact of Twitter on Political Participation](https://www.dropbox.com/s/gp22s3jnelmz34b/Rotesi_Twitter_Participation.pdf?dl=0)
<details>
<!---<summary>Abstract</summary>
What is the effect of Twitter on political participation? I address this question by studying how the spread of this social network affected voting behavior and donations to politicians during the last three US presidential elections. First, I develop a novel measure of Twitter penetration by using location data collected from users. To address endogeneity in the diffusion of Twitter across regions, I exploit variation in the popularity of sport teams that signed new players with Twitter accounts, making therefore the social network more interesting for their fans. Instrumental variables estimates do not show significant effects of Twitter on average participation, intended both as turnout and donations to politicians. On the other hand I find a differential effect across parties, with the Democratic Party being penalized in terms of votes and the Republican Party receiving more donations. I provide two pieces of evidence on mechanisms. First, I show that Twitter reduces voters' information about politics and increases political polarization. Second, by downloading and categorizing tweets written by users I show that the majority of users write about sport or entertainment and ignore politics for most part of the year. Peaks in interest happen only during presidential debates, when both the quantity of partisan tweets and the average sentiment favor the Republican Party.</p>

### Information Transmission in a Social Network: A Controlled Field Experiment
*(with Eleonora Patacchini and Paolo Pin)*
<summary>Draft available upon request</summary> <p>Using an app for smartphones we run an experiment among high school students to study the pattern of aggregation of sparsely distributed information when competing agents are arranged in small networks and can share only non-verifiable pieces of information. Our first finding is that the level of cooperation is high, especially among students that belong to the same class. Nevertheless the level of centralization of the network significantly affects the final results, with the most central node benefiting in terms of payoffs. By adding a second node with a high centrality we see that the results change significantly, with more signals traveling through the links. We then turn to a parsimonious level-k approach to characterize players according to their behavior in the game. When estimating the model we see that data are consistent with a vast majority of players acting cooperatively, with the difference across networks driven mainly by a small share of strategic players and their position in the network.</p></details>
